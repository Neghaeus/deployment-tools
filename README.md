# Deployment Scripts
ðŸ“¦ A centralized repository containing various deployment scripts for different types of projects (PHP, Node.js, etc.).

## Objective
This repository aims to gather multiple `.sh` scripts used to automate the deployment of projects built with different technologies (PHP, Node.js, etc.).

Each script is designed to be **easy to use**, **modular**, and **adaptable** to the specific needs of the project.

## For PHP projects
Make sure to have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your system.

## For Node.js projects
Make sure to have npm (via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) directly) installed on your system.

## Contribute
Contributions are welcome! If you have a useful script or an improvement to propose, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
